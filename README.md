## 🎯 The Problem

California faces severe and ongoing water scarcity. Most households lack visibility into how much water they actually use day-to-day — making it difficult to change behavior, detect waste, or take advantage of conservation rebates. The H₂O Hackathon challenged 64 teams to build innovative solutions to preserve California's most precious natural resource.
